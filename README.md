# Project Description:
The project will focus on building a personalized music recommendation system based on user
listening preferences. Core features include searching by artist, song, or genre, or utilizing Spotify
user’s listening habits using Spotify’s Web API. Features such as incorporating cross platform
recommendations (Youtube, Apple Music, etc.) will not be incorporated into our catalog. We also
will not be utilizing a global dataset; recommendations will be based on user-specific listening
habits.

Our solution is a website that asks the user for a list of songs, artists, or genres that they like.
The site will then use the Spotify public web API to query for songs or artists that are similar to
the ones provided, choosing which ones to display using our algorithm. The website then
displays the results to the user, providing them a list of songs that they'll most likely enjoy but
aren't too far outside of their comfort zone. A method of generating a playlist will be explored.
